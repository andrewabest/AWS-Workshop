# AWS-Workshop
Workshop content for the Readify QLD AWS Knowledge Share session

## Prerequisites

You will need to have installed [The AWS.NET SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/). You could optionally install The [AWS VS Tooling](http://aws.amazon.com/visualstudio/) instead which includes the SDK, and also gives you intellisense for CloudFormation templates.

The samples within assume you are using the [AWS SDK Credential Store](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/specifying-your-aws-credentials.html). You will need to store an appropriate set of credentials under the "AWSWorkshop" profile to execute the samples. *ResetCredentials.bat* will help accomplish this.

### Disclaimer

What is presented here is 101 level infrastructure automation, and is not intended as a production solution. Most production rollouts in AWS will involve a significantly more complex setup to enforce appropriate security and scalability - for a reference architecture, see [Amazon's examples](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Scenario3.html).
