### Disclaimer

What is presented here is 101 level infrastructure automation, and is not intended as a production solution. Most production rollouts in AWS will involve a significantly more complex setup to enforce appropriate security and scalability - for a reference architecture, see [Amazon's examples](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Scenario3.html).
